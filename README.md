# Book-Notes
This is a personal web application that contains reviews of books that I've read.
To use this application in your computer,
1) Download all these files and store it in a folder
2) Run "npm i" command to install all node modules in your computer
3) Run "node index.js" and go over to "localhost:3000" to see the final application.

Beware that the book reviews are completely personal and is not to offend anyone!
